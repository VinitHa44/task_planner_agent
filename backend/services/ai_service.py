        üö® CRITICAL TRAVEL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS:
        
        1. **ARRIVAL & ACCOMMODATION PRIORITY:**
           - FIRST task must be arrival (airport/train station pickup)
           - SECOND task must be hotel check-in near major attractions
           - Choose hotel location strategically - close to most places you'll visit
           - Include exact hotel recommendations with area names
        
        2. **WEATHER-SMART PLANNING (MANDATORY):**
           - ANALYZE each day's weather forecast provided above
           - If rainy/stormy weather predicted: prioritize INDOOR activities (museums, shopping malls, covered markets, restaurants)
           - If very hot (>40¬∞C): plan early morning (6-10 AM) and evening (5-8 PM) outdoor activities, midday (11 AM-4 PM) MUST be indoor
           - If very cold or extreme weather: add weather warnings and suggest alternative indoor options
           - For each activity, EXPLICITLY mention how weather affects the choice: "Due to 80% rain probability, visiting the indoor City Palace instead of outdoor Amber Fort"
           - Rate weather suitability for each day: "Weather Rating: X/10 for outdoor activities"
           - Include weather-appropriate clothing suggestions
        
        3. **FUEL-EFFICIENT ROUTE OPTIMIZATION:**
           - Plan routes in geographical clusters to minimize travel time and fuel
           - Start with places NEAR the hotel
           - Then gradually move to FARTHER places
           - End the day back NEAR the hotel
           - NEVER zigzag between far and near places repeatedly
           - Group nearby attractions together in the same time slot
        
        4. **LOGICAL GEOGRAPHICAL PROGRESSION:**
           - Morning: Start with closest attractions to hotel (walking distance if possible)
           - Mid-day: Move to medium-distance attractions
           - Afternoon: Visit the farthest attractions
           - Evening: Return towards hotel area for dinner and rest
           - Include estimated travel times between locations
        
        5. **PRACTICAL TRAVEL DETAILS:**
           - Include specific addresses and landmark references
           - Mention transportation mode (walk, taxi, metro, bus)
           - Add buffer time for travel delays
           - Include meal breaks near the areas you're visiting (not random locations)
           - Suggest restaurants/cafes in the same vicinity as attractions
        
        6. **WEATHER ADVISORY SYSTEM (ENHANCED):**
           - Start each day with: "üå§Ô∏è WEATHER: [condition], [temp range], [rain probability]% - Activity Impact: [how it affects plan]"
           - If extreme weather (storm, extreme heat/cold): "‚ö†Ô∏è WEATHER ADVISORY: [condition] - Plan modified for indoor activities"
           - Rate each day's weather suitability (1-10 scale) for outdoor activities
           - Suggest weather-appropriate backup plans for outdoor activities
        
        7. **TIME OPTIMIZATION:**
           - Account for opening/closing hours of attractions
           - Avoid travel during peak traffic hours when possible
           - Plan lunch near midday attractions, dinner near evening locations
           - Include realistic time estimates including queue/waiting times
        
        8. **INTELLIGENT ACTIVITY PLANNING BY TIME DURATION:**
           - Plan activities based on how long each activity actually takes, not arbitrary daily limits
           - Major attractions (museums, forts, palaces): 2-4 hours each
           - Medium activities (markets, temples, gardens): 1-2 hours each
           - Quick activities (cafes, viewpoints, short walks): 30min-1hr each
           - Full day activities (safari, trekking, day tours): Entire day
           - Calculate total time: Activities + Travel + Meals + Rest = Should not exceed 12-14 hours
           - Example day: Major attraction (3hrs) + Travel (1hr) + Lunch (1hr) + Medium attraction (2hrs) + Travel (30min) + Quick cafe (1hr) + Dinner (1hr) = 9.5hrs ‚úÖ
           - Bad example: 3 Major attractions (12hrs) + Travel (3hrs) + Meals (2hrs) = 17hrs ‚ùå
           - SMART LOGIC: If you plan 1 museum (3hrs), you still have 9-11 hours left for other activities
           - SMART LOGIC: If you plan 3 museums (12hrs), you have no time left for anything else
           - Include travel time between locations (30min-2hours depending on distance)
           - Allow time for rest, meals, and unexpected delays
           - Quality over quantity - better to enjoy fewer places than rush through many
        
        Requirements:
        - Create exactly {extracted_info.get('duration', 1)} days
        - Use the EXACT dates provided in the trip dates section above
        - For each day, reference the weather forecast and adapt activities accordingly
        - Plan activities based on realistic time requirements and do the math:
          * Major attractions (museums, forts, palaces): 2-4 hours each
          * Medium activities (markets, temples, gardens): 1-2 hours each  
          * Quick activities (cafes, viewpoints): 30min-1hr each
          * Full day activities (safari, trekking): Entire day
        - Total daily time should not exceed 12-14 hours (including travel, meals, rest)
        - USE MATH: Add up all activity durations + travel time + meal time = should fit in 12-14 hours
        - Include specific times, locations, and addresses when possible
        - Consider the activities and preferences mentioned
        - Make tasks actionable and specific with clear directions
        - Include realistic travel times between locations (30min-2hrs)
        - Optimize routes for minimal backtracking
        - MANDATORY: Every activity choice must consider the weather forecast for that specific day
        - Account for weather conditions and suggest alternatives
        - Prioritize arrival logistics and smart hotel location
        - Focus on quality experiences over quantity of places
        - LET THE TIME MATH DETERMINE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES, NOT PRE-SET LIMITS
